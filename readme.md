# WARNING

this is a pile of garbage; I figured I'd run with some example code off github
related to creating transparent x11 windows because that was a primary goal of mine,
but all too quickly found myself in an alley with OpenGL xlib and a YUV 422 pixel layout I knew nothing about.


That being said, it is a _FAST_ pile of garbage. This thing is built like the millenium falcon.

# Assumed environment

i3 on arch linux; basically this is built to work on my own laptop
and I don't really consider anyone else's environment. My house my rules.
